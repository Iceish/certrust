# Certrust - API

This is the API for Certrust. It is built with laravel. It is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container that is built with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), along with the sail tool.

‚ùó **Note**: Do not launch this container by itself for production. This readme is for development only. See [certrust](../README.md) for more information about production.
